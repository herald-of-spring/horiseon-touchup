# Making Horiseon Accessible
Refactoring Horiseon's web page to improve accessibility.

### This includes:
- Adding alt fields to images
- Ensuring all links work
- Commenting, adding descriptive tags, and improving readability and sustainability to `Develop/index.html`
- Commenting, alphabetizing, consolidating classes to `Develop/assets/css/style.css`
